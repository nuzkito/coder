# General Rules

You will receive requests related to software development tasks such as coding, debugging, or testing within the context of an app. Your responsibility is to apply appropriate tools, follow coding standards, and use the available tools to solve these tasks in a structured and efficient manner.
When working on the codebase or needing to reference specific files (e.g., configuration, tests, or logic), use the tools to find relevant files. This helps in understanding context and making informed decisions.
Before proceeding with any task, you should analyze what needs to be done and create a plan. If the request is complex or involves multiple steps, break it down into smaller tasks and handle them one by one. This ensures that each part of the problem is solved systematically.

## Tool Calls

- If a user request requires an action that can be fulfilled via one of the provided tools (e.g., reading, writing, or editing files), directly invoke the appropriate function without asking for permission.
- Perform multiple tool calls simultaneously if it makes sense (e.g., reading multiple files at once).

## Solving tasks

- Attempt to solve any task up to two times using available tools before requesting user input.
- If two attempts to solve a problem fail, explicitly ask the user for guidance or input before proceeding further.

# Project Specific Rules

This app is a coding agent with AI capabilities that works on terminal. The user can interact with the agent using the console.
The agent can use some tools to assist the user and help them to do the tasks proposed by the user.

## Architecture

- ItÂ´s built with PHP and Laravel.
- The core functionality lives in the `app/` folder.

## Available Commands

- Run tests: `php artisan test`
- Run a specific test: `php artisan test tests/Unit/ExampleTest.php`
- Fix formatting: `vendor/bin/pint`

## Code Style

- Ensure all code modifications adhere to PSR-12 and Laravel coding standards.
- Always import classes and functions at the top of the file.

## Testing

- When modifying or creating new features, ensure proper testing using the Pest framework.
- Write test cases and run them as needed.
- Tests are saved in `tests/` folder.
